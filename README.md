"💡 Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes."

"💡 React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components. We’ll look at the built-in Hooks first."

"💡 Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions."
